\section{Conclusions and Extensions}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system can successfully build portfolios with different MDD upon the same validation period using various thresholds and outperformed CRP Portfolios in most cases.
    \item Including noises in the features avoids over-fitting and improve the performance during validation.
    \item Apply penalties against drop shows unstable performance. The cause could be lacking negative returns sample during training could be the cause.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Dynamic adjusting the threshold with investors' preferences and the status of the market could give a more predictable and reliable performance.
    \item Improve feature processing or selection of the investment universe.
    \item Extend our system to other investors' preferences. For example, the opinion of the investor used in Blackâ€“Litterman model. The system will offer investors tailor-made optimal portfolios.
\end{itemize}
