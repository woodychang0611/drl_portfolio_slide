\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Objective 1 accomplished, system can produce portfolios with different MDD by adjusting thresholds 
        \item Objective 2 accomplished, outperformed CRP Portfolios in most cases 
        \item Include noises feature reduce over-fitting and improve validation performance
        \item Apply penalties against drop only shows unstable performance. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Dynamic adjusting the threshold with the market.
    \item Improve feature processing or selection of the investment universe.
